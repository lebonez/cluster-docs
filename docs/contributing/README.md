# Contributing {docsify-ignore-all}

If you want to contribute to the cluster docs project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and their ecosystems and how to make constructive, helpful tutorials, information pages, and correction issues.

### Guides to contributing

- [Contribute using the Github Website](contributing/github-website.md)
  - Recommended workflow for beginners to contribute by using the Github website allowing you to add and edit files directly from a browser.
  - Type up the content in a separate location outside of the Github file editor (i.e. Notepad), then copy and paste to the new file from the guide linked above.

- [Contribute using the local Git command line](contributing/github-cli.md)
  - Recommended for advanced users with knowledge of Git commands or users that would like to learn about using purely command line.

- [Contribute simply by writing a document using an application like Microsoft Office Word or Notepad](#contributing)
  - Recommended for users who would like to contribute without using or learning Git.
  - There are no specific guides on how to do this. Create a typical document with all content including images, then email the document to its-cluster-support@siue.edu.
  - Formatting and pushing to the [Github cluster-docs repo](https://github.com/SIUE-ITS/cluster-docs) will be done by the ITS cyberinfrastruture team.
