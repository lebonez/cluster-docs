# Contributing using Github CLI

Below is highly recommended reading for any new user. Git CLI will likely be used nearly all the time throughout your cyberinfrastructure usage. The Git CLI developers site is available [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line)

That tutorial will walk through installing on any operating system as well as explain every subcommand of the `git` command.

Lastly, since it wouldn't be nearly as useful or comprehensive to give steps on using Git CLI on this site. [Here](https://github.com/progit/progit2/releases/download/2.1.313/progit.pdf) is an entire PDF on using Git.
