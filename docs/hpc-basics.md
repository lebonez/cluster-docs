# HPC Basics
High-performance computing (HPC) aggregates the resources from individual computers (known as nodes) into a cluster that works together to perform advanced, specialized computing jobs. The ITS Cyberinfrastructure team launched its new general-purpose high-performance campus computing cluster in August 2021,  For more information on HPC, see our High-Performance Computing page.
